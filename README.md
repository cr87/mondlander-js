# mondlander-js
Mondlander, a COVID-19 quarantine project. 

I have no idea about js and web development best practices, so the code is most likely a mess. I spent around 12 hours on this project during my 14 day COVID-19 quarantine period, including learning about pixi.js and researching the parameters for the lunar lander, atmospheric drag on the moon (well, there's basically none, but most lunar lander games implement it...) and so on. Don't say you haven't been warned!

TODO:
- Implement score system
- Fix messy terrain repeating logic, will cause issues when trying to land on the "seam"
- Make starfield more uniform (and make stars smaller in zoomed mode)
- Fix zoom mode in small display height scenarios
- Show less empty space (below mountain surface) in zoom mode
- Implement some tolerance for landing terrain segment selection?
- Add crash explosion (ugh...)
- Add sound
